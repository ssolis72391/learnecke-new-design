By 1853, Britain\u2019s Sir George Cayley created aglider with fixed wings, cambered airfoil, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These gliderseventually evolved into flying machines similar to today\u2019s hang gliders. In 1861, a Balloon Corpsprovided aerial observation and reconnaissance for the Union Army during the American CivilWar. The seven balloons in the inventory proved to be useful, but they were fragile andvulnerable to weather conditions. In 1863, the Army disbanded the Union Army Balloon Corps.",

A drawdown was enacted in 1918 that called for a reduction in Air Service personnelfrom 190,000 to fewer than 20,000. Likewise, the $460 million allocated for military aviation in1919 fell to $25 million in 1920. Another challenge came about when Congress demanded thatnew military aircraft use the surplus Liberty engines produced during the World War I buildup.Consequently, World War I vintage Curtiss JN-3 Jennies and Liberty DH-4 bombers remained inservice until the 1930s, despite technological advances that had been made in airframe andengine design.",

General Headquarters Air Force was established with the recognitionthat technological advances in aircraft would eventually propel airpower forward as a significantmilitary force, beyond its early role of solely supporting ground troops. In 1938, when the UnitedStates first took the signs of war in Europe seriously, the Army\u2019s Air Arm was still split into twocumbersome command organizations, the Army Air Corps and General Headquarters Air Force.In 1939, President Roosevelt asked for an appropriation of $300 million for military aviation.Before the outbreak of hostilities in Europe in the fall of 1939, General Headquarters Air Forcehad begun the massive expansion program that eventually evolved into the largest airorganization in the Nation\u2019s history.",
